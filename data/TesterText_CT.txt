Closing time Open all the doors and let you out into the world 
Turn the lights up over every boy and every girl 
last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey or beer 
You dont have to go home but you cant stay here I know who 
I want to take me home Time for you to go out to the places you 
will be from This room wont be open til your brothers or you 
sisters come So gather up your jackets, and move it to the 
exits I hope you have found a friend Every new beginning comes 
from some other beginnings end Time for you to go out 
to the places you will be from
