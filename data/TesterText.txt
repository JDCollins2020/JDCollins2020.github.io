Plants that are more resistant to abiotic stresses such as salinity can be achieved through 
manipulation of their DNA and could be advantageous in agriculture. Previous studies show that 
the gene, AsHAK5, derived from Creeping bentgrass Agrostis stolonifera, appears to regulate the Na+ and 
K+ ion ratio in plants, contributing to salt tolerance. While the underlying mechanism is not entirely 
clear, AsHAK5 is part of the KP/HAK/KT transporter family that codes for both K+ ion channels and transporters. 
This particular gene supposedly codes for a K+ transporter that controls the uptake of K+ ions from the soil; 
this theory will be tested through cloning of the gene and manipulation of its expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. 
The full length cDNA of the gene AsHAK5 from Creeping bentgrass was subcloned into the binary vector PSBbarBUbi, 
to create an expression vector for AsHAK5 overexpression. The expression vector will be transformed into 
Agrobacterium for Arabidopsis infection by floral dip method to deliver the chimeric gene construct. 
Transgenic plants will be tested for the expression of the inserted gene and its impact on plant response to salt stress. 
Information obtained may help develop new strategy to genetically engineer crops for enhanced tolerance to 
abiotic stresses.
